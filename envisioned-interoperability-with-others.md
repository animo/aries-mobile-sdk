# Envisioned interoperability with others

Interoperability is a core aspect of SSI. There are many options for interoperability and collaboration with other eSSIF solutions.

- Sphereon pe-js: We'll leverage this for the present proof protocol
- Trinsic Trust registry: This is not on our current roadmap, but something we're very interested to pursue and integrate.
- Zero Trust VC: This is not on our current roadmap, but we would be interested to integrate authentication mechanisms into the SDK. We would need to add support for JWT credentials in addition to JSON-LD credentials in this case
- DKMS4SSI: We'd be very interested to integrate Keri identifiers into our SDK, but are unsure of the required effort at the moment. We'll need to do further investigation into the possibilities.
- Ubitech DOOR: Focuses on holder, binding credentials to a specific wallet. Would be interesting to see if this could be easily integrated into the mobile SDK.
