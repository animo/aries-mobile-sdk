## Context

The Aries Mobile SDK is a complete toolkit for cross-platform iOS and Android SSI application development using React Native. With this one SDK, developers can build mobile SSI solutions for any use case. The SDK contains reusable issuer, holder and verifier components as well as essential components for mobile development (e.g. deep linking, state management and biometric wallet unlocking). Developers can either start from scratch or integrate a selection of components into their existing mobile app. The Aries Mobile SDK is credential format and DID method agnostic, and uses the latest open standards to break out of the Indy & Aries ecosystem (e.g. W3C VCs, DIF PE, BBS+ Signatures).

The Aries Mobile SDK is 100% open-source, focuses on interoperability and open standards and is accessible for developers of any skill level. It aims to drastically lower the barrier of mobile SSI development.
